recipeingredient:
- " Arugula or salad greens"
- "1/2 cup Chicken precooked"
- "1/4 medium Apple Fugi or anything crisp"
- "1/4 cup Goat cheese crumbles"
- "2 pinch Muruku pieces Indian bean curd spirals for crunch"
- " Ground pepper"
- " Vinaigrette"
- "1 Vinegar pomegranate or red wine"
- "1 dash Vinegar balsamic to add flavor depth"
- "1 Oil grape seed or EVOO"
recipeinstructions:
- "Arugula is pretty peppery and the trick is to  pile a serving onto a plate and use your kitchen scissors (clean) to rough-cut the pile. It releases the flavor and brings out the crispness..."
- "Add chicken, cut to bite-sized chunks."
- "Slice 1/4 to 1/2 a medium apple. If you&#39;re concerned about carbs counts, 1/4 medium apple is one serving @ about 15 grams of carbs."
- "Drizzle vinaigrette over chicken (absorbs the flavor) to taste. Top with fresh ground pepper and goat cheese crumbles."
- "Top with Muruku crunchies. Especially good for diabetics or those watching carbs, the Indian bean curd snack can be found at most food co-ops and is worth the monthly trek to keep a stash in your pantry."
