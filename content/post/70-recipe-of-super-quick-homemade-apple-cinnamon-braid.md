recipeingredient:
- " Apple Filling"
- "4 medium Honey Crisp Apples"
- "4 tbsp granulated sugar"
- "2 1/2 tbsp ground cinnamon"
- "2 tbsp lemon juice"
- " Dough Braid"
- "2 1/2 cup allpurpose flour"

- " Glaze"
- "1 cup powdered sugar"
- "2 tsp ground nutmeg"
- "2 tbsp milk"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/2 cup ground nuts optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "You will need:"
- "Preheat oven to 350°F"
- "Peel the apple&#39;s, cut in half and de-seed. Then cut into small pieces."
- "In a medium bowl, toss the apple&#39;s with the cinnamon, sugar, and lemon juice until well coated."
- "Put in a baking dish and bake for 18 minutes.  Once done, remove from oven and set aside."
- "While the filling is baking- start the Dough Braid. In a large mixing bowl sift together the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt."
- "In another bowl, mix together the food coloring and water, then add the oil. The food coloring is optional. **Note** to make this festive for autumn for Halloween or Autumn mix food coloring to make the dough orange!"

- "Spread your filling down the center evenly."
- "Starting at the top, alternately crisscross the cut peices over top of the filling, pinching at the sides to secure it."

- "While this is baking make the Glaze. Sift together the powdered sugar and nutmeg. Then add in the milk and teaspoon of vanilla extract and stir well."
- "Crush the nuts using a mortar and pestle"
- "Remove the braid from the oven once the time is up and brush the glaze on. Then sprinkle with the nuts."
- "Return to the oven for 5 minutes."
- "Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes."
- "Serve and enjoy! Vanilla Bean ice cream goes great with this."
